## Background and Overview
Pet Portal is a web application designed to simplify pet care management for pet owners. With Pet Portal, users can create profiles for their pets, track their health records, and set reminders for important events like vaccinations, preventatives, and appointments. The platform aims to streamline the pet care process, providing users with a centralized hub for managing some common aspects of their pets' health.

## Current Features:
1. **JWT-based User Authentication:**

- Users must log in to access the Pet Portal platform.

- üîë*There is a demo user available to try out these features!*
- The session will auto-refresh as it nears its expiration, but if unsuccessful or if expiration happens while the app is not loaded, will prompt the user to log in and refresh their session.

2. **Pets:** *(CRUD feature)* 
- **Dashboard** The dashboard serves as the central hub for users to manage their pets and appointments. It displays an index of the user's pets along with any upcoming reminders or events, such as vaccinations, labwork, and vet appointments. Users can add new pets to their dashboard and upload a profile photo. From here, users can navigate to their individual pets' profiles to view/edit detailed information. </br>

- **Pet Profiles**
- Users can view individual pet summaries on their pets' profiles, including physical characteristics and microchip/insurance information. 
- Profiles also house reminder modules that categorize reminders by type and display details for vaccines, medications, and appointments. 

- Users may edit or delete their pet's profiles from here as well. </br>

3. **Reminders:** *(CRUD feature)* 
- This module provides a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and deleting reminders. 
- Reminders can be made under several categories, including appointments/procedures, vaccines, and preventatives, and render details specific to each type of reminder.
- Vaccines that are due in < 2 months have a yellow indicator, green if due in > 2 months, and red if overdue.
- Users can set reminders for specific dates and times, as well as assign reminders to individual pets.</br>

4. **RESTful, user-friendly Express routing:**
- This app utilizes the power and flexibility of Express.js, with the ability to add fully customizable middleware for defining endpoint behavior & robust error handling to any route, while keeping it organized and user-friendly by adopting a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
- This pattern makes it easy to collaborate with the front end to add or change routes and behaviors as the need arises.

```js
const reminderRouter = Router()

reminderRouter.get('/user/:id', ReminderController.indexByUser)
reminderRouter.get('/pet/:id', ReminderController.indexByPet)
reminderRouter.get('/:id', ReminderController.show)
reminderRouter.post('/', requireUser, ReminderController.create)
reminderRouter.put('/:id', requireUser, ReminderController.update)
reminderRouter.delete('/:id', requireUser, ReminderController.delete)
```
