## Background and Overview
Pet Portal is a web application designed to simplify pet care management for pet owners. With Pet Portal, users can create profiles for their pets, track their health records, set reminders for important events like vaccinations, preventatives, and appointments, and track metrics on their pets over time. The platform aims to streamline the pet care process, providing users with a centralized hub for managing some common aspects of their pets' health.

## Features:
Users must log in to access the Pet Portal platform.
There is a demo user available to try out these features!

1. **Dashboard:** The dashboard serves as the central hub for users to manage their pets and appointments. It displays an index of the user's pets along with any upcoming reminders or events, such as vaccinations, labwork, and vet appointments. Users can add new pets to their dashboard and upload a profile photo. From here, users can navigate to their individual pets' profiles to view/edit detailed information.

2. **Pet Profiles:** Users can view individual pet summaries, including physical characteristics and microchip/insurance information. Profiles also house reminder modules that categorize reminders by type and display details for vaccines, medications, and appointments. Users may edit or delete their pet's profiles from here as well.

3. **Reminders:** This module provides a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and deleting reminders. Reminders can be made under several categories, including appointments/procedures, vaccines, labwork, preventatives, and contain details specific to each type of reminder.  Users can set reminders for specific dates and times, as well as assign reminders to individual pets.
